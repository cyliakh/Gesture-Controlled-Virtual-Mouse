# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse

AI Virtual Mouse controlled by gesture using OpenCV and Mediapipe with Python.

    1- Hand and finger tracking.
    
    2- Options and features with the tracked fingers.
    
    
 In this example we have four options: Single click, double click, right click, press/release.
 
 ***Single click:*** Thumb (tip) with index (pip) fingers.
 
 ***Double click:*** Index (tip) with middle (tip) fingers.
 
 ***Right click:*** Middle (tip) with ring (tip) fingers.
 
 ***Press:*** Thumb (tip) with index (tip) fingers.
 
We avoided using autopy since it doesn't run on all Python versions (Python 2.7, or Python 3.5 til 3.8) which makes it limited so the required libraries are:
 

    1- OpenCV Python
    
    2- Numpy & Math
    
    3- Mediapipe
    
    4- Mouse
